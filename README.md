Hi.

Me and my team made this code for a project we were working on.  This project is about making a mouse for visually impaired people based on microbit.

The language we used is micropython.

I hope you find this useful, it would be updated.

Thanks!
Team 9 (Amari, Ram Vargas, todocono, molly, Eric, Cici Xue)
